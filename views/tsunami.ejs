				<li>Establish whether your home and other places you frequent are in tsunami hazard areas.</li>
				<li>Know how high above sea level your street is and how far it is from the coast. Evacuation orders may be based on those figures.</li>
				<li>Cobble together an <a href="http://www.redcross.org/local/oregon/preparedness/resource-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">emergency supplies kit</a>.</li>
				<li>Plan your escape and evacuation routes. From the Red Cross: "If possible, pick areas 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland, away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every foot inland or upward may make a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes."&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Practice evacuating.</li>
				<li>Know your children's school evacuation plans and figure out how to get them.</li>
				<li>Tourists should get familiar with evacuation information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

				<li>If there's an earthquake while you are on the coast and indoors, drop, cover and hold on. If you're outside, stay away from falling objects.</li>
				
				<li>When the shaking is over, move quickly to inland, higher ground. Go on foot if you can. Stay there until officials say it's all clear.</li>
